### Need for a developer portal
A developer portal = one frontend for your entire infrastructure

Unifies all your tooling, services, apps, data, and docs with a single, consistent Ul

Makes sense of everything in your ecosystem, regardless of how and where individual components are running

Let developers focus on what they do best(leading to much less activity in #aaargh Slack channel)



### Why Backstage or similar tool needed?
Software is still eating the world

Trends like microservices, SaaS sprawl, and cloud-everything create a chaotic ecosystem for engineers.

Every company uses different subsets of these tools and faces different challenges.

Your whole stack is getting more complex; onboarding and collaboration are becoming more difficult.



### What is Backstage?
Backstage is a platform for building developer portals. It unifies an organisation’s tooling, services, apps, data, and docs into a single UI that allows developers to easily create, manage, and explore software. An internal developer portal is also a key tool to support InnerSource. Innersource is a software development methodology that applies the principles of open source software development to an organisation’s internal software projects. It involves sharing code, best practices, and knowledge among development teams within an organisation, enabling them to collaborate more effectively and efficiently.

Backstage was created at Spotify in 2016 when the company grew incredibly quickly, and onboarding new engineers was becoming a challenge. The project became Spotify’s mission-critical tool for containing software chaos and empowering engineers to work faster and more efficiently. Spotify open-sourced Backstage in March 2020 to share its experience with the broader community, and Backstage joined the CNCF in 2022.
